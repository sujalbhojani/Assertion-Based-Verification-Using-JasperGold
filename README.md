# Assertion-Based Verification with JasperGold

This repository contains materials related to the assertion-based verification of digital circuits using Cadence's JasperGold. The primary focus is on verifying a synchronous FIFO design using SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA).

## Introduction

Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a powerful technique used to validate the behavior of digital designs. Assertions are conditions or properties that are expected to be true in the design under all conditions. Using JasperGold, a formal verification tool by Cadence, these assertions are checked against the design, providing a robust method to catch bugs and ensure correct functionality.

This project demonstrates ABV on a synchronous FIFO design, covering the basics of SVA, setting up JasperGold, and analyzing the coverage results.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following key files:

- **`sync_fifo.sva`**: SystemVerilog Assertions file that contains the assertions used for verifying the FIFO design.
- **`run.tcl`**: A TCL script to run JasperGold with the necessary settings and parameters for coverage analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Cadence JasperGold**: Ensure that JasperGold is installed and properly set up in your environment.
- **SystemVerilog**: Basic understanding of SystemVerilog and assertions is recommended.

## Usage

To perform the verification:

1. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure the `sync_fifo.sva` file is properly configured for your design.
   - Edit the `run.tcl` script if necessary to point to your design files or adjust parameters.

2. **Run JasperGold**:
   - Use the provided command to initiate JasperGold.
   - Command:
     ```sh
    jg -cov
     ```
   -Use run.tcl script to perform formal verification and measure code coverage metrics like branch, statement, expression, and functional coverage using the JasperGold Coverage App.
3. **Analyze the Results**:
   - Upon completion, review the coverage statistics and logs generated by JasperGold to ensure all assertions are validated.

## Files

- **`sync_fifo.sva`**: Contains the assertions for the FIFO design.
- **`run.tcl`**: TCL script to execute the JasperGold verification.
